# Sandwich-Remake
I made this project as mobile module while studing at Event Horizon. Is based on the mobile game Sandwich.

The aim of the game is to build a sandwich by flipping ingredients on the grid, one at a time. The level is completed if all ingredients are stacked, with the two slices of bread forming the base and the top of the stack.
The prototype must contain at least three levels.

Features:
 -4x4 grid
- Two slices of bread per level
- At least two different types of ingredient
- Touch control (swipe to flip the ingredient)
- Button to reset the level
- Button to undo the last move made
